## Hi, I'm Mike Williams! 👋

I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in aviation technology and software development. With years of experience in **.NET** and a love for **Raspberry Pi** projects, I created this blog to share my knowledge and help others on their learning journey.

### What I Write About

**✈️ Piaware & ADS-B**

Track aircraft in real-time with your own receiver setup. I cover everything from initial setup to advanced troubleshooting.

**💻 .NET Development**

From basics to advanced topics - web APIs, Entity Framework, testing, and modern development practices.

### My Philosophy

> "The best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to solidify knowledge is by teaching others."

Every tutorial I write comes from real-world experience. I believe in clear, practical explanations that help you understand not just the *how*, but also the *why*.
